sulfur content of 0.07 wt percent. The Akpo field lies in Block OM 130
which is located about 125 miles south of Port Harcourt in water depths
of 1,000 - 1,700 m in the Niger Delta, offshore Nigeria. OM 130 covers
over 500 sq miles and includes the Egina and Preowei fields, which are
separate developments. Akpo was discovered in 2000 and holds reserves
of 620 million barrels of condensate and more than 1 Tcf of gas. The
field came on stream in March 2009 and in 2010 production averaged
175,000 b/d. Production in 2011 is expected to fall by at least 10
percent because of a fire onboard the drillship GSF Jack Ryan which
delayed development drilling in early 2011. Drilling is expected to
recommence by late 2011 and production should rebound back to 175,000
b/d by 2012. The Akpo development consists of 22 producing wells, 20
water and two gas injections wells. Output is tied back to the Akpo
FPSO which has a production capacity of 225,000 b/d and a storage
capacity of 2 million boe. Total has a 24 percent stake and operates
the field on behalf of Petrobras (15 percent). China National Offshore

Development of Al Shaheen took place in three phases. Phase 1 started
up in 1995 and had an initial production rate of 100,000 b/d. Phase 2,
which started up in 2004, increased field capacity to 240,000 b/d.
Phase 3, an extension of the Al Shaheen field, came on stream in 2006.
Phase 3 was to increase capacity to 540,000 b/s, however due to OPEC
quotas, production will be capped to 300,000 b/d. Al Shaheen currently
produces 298,000 b/d (2010). Maersk owns and operates the field.

weight percent sulfur, is produced from the field. Alvheim was
discovered in 1998 and after a series of delays, was finally brought
online in 2008. In 2009, the production rate ranged from
125,000-135,000 b/d. Most of the recoverable oil is from three main
reservoirs: Kneler, Kameleon and Boa. Combined initial reserves from
these three reservoirs were estimated at 255.4 million bbl, of which
171.1 million bbl remain (2009). Vilje, also known as Klegg, and Volund
fields holds 39 million bbl and 45.3 million bbl, respectively. Phase 2
of the Alvheim field is expected to bring three additional development
wells from the Marihone and Viper exploration discoveries online in
2011. Alvheim s output is loaded into the Alvheim FPSO and is then
transported via shuttle tankers. Marathon oil is the operator and holds
a 65 percent stake in the Kneler, Kameleon, and Boa reservoirs.
ConocoPhillips (20 percent) and Lundin Petroleum (15 percent) own the

API), low sulfur (0.09 weight percent) crude oil that contains high
amounts of mercury (greater than 200 ppb). Crude is produced through a
45,000 b/d capacity flowstation and then transported through the
Amukpe-Rapele pipeline to the Forcados terminal where it is blended
into the Forcados grade. The Amukpe field had initial recoverable
reserves of 60 million boe, of which 42 million remain (2010). In 2010,
production averaged at 5,000 b/d. The Nigerian Petroleum Development
Corporation (NPDC) operates the field and holds 24.75 percent interest.

Antan is an interesting crude exported
from Knock Taggart FPSO/Antan Terminal. Its quality has risen and
fallen many times over time. Currently, at 29*API/0.25 percent S/ 2400
ppm N with an 11.7K, it is lower than its once historical 36*API. Antan
(aka Addax Blend) is a blend of crudes from the offshore license areas
OML 123 and OML 114, totaled around 68 K b/d in 2009, It was produced
by Swiss-based Addax Petroleum but, after the acquisition of Addax, the
operator is Unipec, a Sinopec member. They recently struck oil in
UDELE-3 well of Block 137, in the Niger Delta which may be commingled
into Antan in the future. Historically, Antan was a Nigerian Light
grade. Current quality drops it below Forcados. Crude is medium, sweet,
a bit acidic.

Extra Light is a Light , medium-sulfur Mideast Crude oil similar to
top quality Abu Dhabi grades, It is suitable for making Kerosene and
Petrochemical naphtha, but , unlike west African and North sea crude
oil grades, it is not especially good for gasoline manufacturing.
Arab Extra Light is sourced from the Berri and Abqaiq Fields and since
1998 from the Shaybah field in the Rub al-Khali desert near the border
with Abu Dhabi. Shaybah, which contains 15 bbl of reserves contributes
roughly 500,000 barrels per day to Arab Extra Light Flows, the second
phase of the Shaybah development, which is due to be completed by
2008, will boost production by further 300,000-400,000 b/d from the
mid 2006 levels of 1.4 million b/d. the field also produces 880
million cubic feet per day of associated gas. The Shaybah  complex
includes three separation plants and a 636 km pipeline to connect the
field to Abqaiq, the closest gathering center, for  blending with Arab
light crude (Berri and Abqaiq streams).  The Crude is produced
entirely by Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco). 100% State owned

been a change in the API of Asgard due to the introduction of the

Amerada Petroleum from the H. O. Bakken No.1 well in Williams County.
The Bakken Formation, initially described by geologist J.W. Nordquist
in 1953, is a rock unit from the Late Devonian to Early Mississippian
age occupying about 200,000 square miles of the subsurface of the
Williston Basin, covering parts of Montana, North Dakota, and
Saskatchewan. The rock formation consists of three members: lower
shale, middle dolomite, and upper shale. The shales were deposited in
relatively deep marine conditions, and the dolomite was deposited as a
coastal carbonate bank during a time of shallower water. The middle
dolomite member is the principal oil reservoir, roughly two miles below
the surface. Both the upper and lower shale members are organic-rich
marine shale. The greatest Bakken oil production comes from Elm Coulee
Oil Field, Richland County, Montana, where production began in 2000 and
is expected to ultimately total 270 million barrels. In 2007,
production from Elm Coulee averaged 53,000 barrels per day. However, N
Dakota is where current production is focused. New interest developed
in 2007 when EOG Resources out of Houston, Texas reported that a single
well it had drilled into an oil-rich layer of shale below Parshall,
North Dakota was anticipated to produce 700,000 barrels (111,000 m3) of
oilThis, combined with other factors, including an oil-drilling tax
break enacted by the state of North Dakota in 2007, shifted attention
in the Bakken from Montana to the North Dakota side. The number of
wells drilled in the North Dakota Bakken jumped from 300 in 2006 to 457
in 2007.  Crude from  Mountrail County wells generally has API gravity
between 40-45. this sample is crude aggregated at Truck stations in
N.DAKOTA and MONTANA and loaded on to railroad cars. Data are very
limited and provide no molecules.

API and 0.01 wt percent sulfur) with a high mercury content (457 ppb)
and high crude pour point temperature (69.8 degrees F). The field was
discovered in 1975 and came on stream in 2004. Initial reserves are
estimated at 53 million barrels of oil, 35 million barrels of
condensate, 20 million barrels equivalent of LPG and 360 bcf gas.
Remaining reserves (2010) are 13 million barrels of oil, 10 million
barrels condensate, 15 million barrels equivalent of LPG, and 217 bcf
gas. Production in 2009 averaged 43,000 b/d, a decline from 2008
because of weather related problems. Output is tied back to the Belanak
FPSO which can process 60,000 b/d and store up to 1 million boe. The
FPSO also has a mercury removal unit that can reduce up to 1200 ppb
mercury to zero. ConocoPhillips operates the field and holds a 40

Production is tied back to the Berantai FPSO then transported via
shuttle tankers for export. A 12-inch, 30 km pipeline is used to
transport produced gas to the Angsi Central Processing Platform (CPP).
From there, it is sent to the onshore terminal at Kerteh through a
32-inch, 166 km pipeline. Berantai condensate has an API of 53.1

million barrels of condensate and 212 bcf gas, of which 19 million
barrels of oil, 1 million barrels condensate and 205 bcf gas remain.
Produced oil is tied back to the Berantai FPSO then transported via
shuttle tankers for export. A 12-inch, 30 km pipeline is used to
transport produced gas to the Angsi Central Processing Platform (CPP).
From there, it is sent to the onshore terminal at Kerteh through a
32-inch, 166 km pipeline. Berantai condensate (BERCND697) has an API of
69.7 degrees . It has a low sulfur content (0.003 wt percent) and a low

by Talisman Energy (UK) Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian
company Talisman Energy Inc, and owned by Talisman (51.99 percent),
Intrepid Energy North Sea Ltd. (13 percent), Kerr-McGee Resources (UK)

transported via flow lines to a subsea production manifold for onward
transportation to the Bleo Holm FPSO (9.5km away) via 10in and 12in
production lines. On the FPSO, the Blake fluids are processed with
those from the Ross field. Additionally, Blake contains Blank Flank
production. The Blake Flank development is a smaller developed oil
field directly adjacent to the original Blake Channel . The first
production from Blake Flank was brought online in September 2003 with
an estimated flow rate of 5,200 barrels a day. The field is operated by
BG Group with a 44 percent interest and the remainder being held by
Talisman Energy (53.6 percent) and Paladin Resources (2.4 percent). The
Blake Flank field is tied into the current Blake production pipeline

million barrels of condensate and 212 bcf gas, of which 19 million
barrels of oil, 1 million barrels condensate and 205 bcf gas remain.
Produced oil is tied back to the Berantai FPSO then transported via
shuttle tankers for export. A 12-inch, 30 km pipeline is used to
transport produced gas to the Angsi Central Processing Platform (CPP).
From there, it is sent to the onshore terminal at Kerteh through a

gravity. It has a total of 39 wells, of which 30 are said to be
producing. Bu Attifel has been producing since the early 1970s and
several discoveries since then have added to its reserve base. Of the
five discoveries made in 1990-1994, two were oil-rich structures near
Bu ttifel discovered by Agip. This is one of the waxiest crudes.  The
crude is a light yellow brown and resid is pale. Heteroatoms are very

sediments of western Turkmenistan contain significant reserves of oil
and gas in fluvial and deltaic reservoirs. Oil has been produced from
the area commercially for over 100 years, initially from shallow
hand-dug wells targeting oil seeps. The Burun Field was discovered in
1967 and currently produces 1550 m3 of oil per day (9750 bopd) of 33
API sweet crude and 1 MMm3 of gas per day (35 MMscf/d) from 88 wells
(as of Jan. 2003). The field is approximately 10 km by 3 km and
comprises stacked reservoirs of Neogene age, with an overall anticlinal
structure developed as a result of dextral shear. Over 200 wells have
been drilled on the structure, with 50 currently on production.

offshore Angola. Cabinda crude, which accounts for almost 60 percent of
Angola's oil production, came onstream in 1968. Cabinda Area A Block 0
is comprised of the Takula, Malongo, Mafumeria, and Kambala complex
which hold 2.154 billion boe, 1.373 billion boe, 379 million boe and 85
million boe, respectively, of initial recoverable reserves. Remaining
reserves are 180 million boe, 91 million boe, 287 million boe, and 22
million boe, respectively (2017). Output from each complex is sent via
pipeline to the Malongo Terminal where it is blended and marketed as
the Cabinda Blend. In 2013, production averaged 176,370 b/d. The
Cabinda Area A concession is operated by Chevron (39.20 percent).
Sonagol EP (41 percent), Total (10 percent), and Eni (9.8 percent) are
joint venture partners.

Vietnam. The field was discovered in 2006 and went onstream in October
2011 and production hit its peak production rate of 25,000 b/d in
November 2011. Chim Sao's recoverable reserves are estimated at 54
million boe and 65 bcf of gas. As of yearend 2011, 52 million boe and
64 bcf gas remain. Chim Sao crude oil is waxy, light gravity (40.1
degrees API), and low in sulfur (0.002 weight percent) with a high
crude pour point (96 degrees F) and high measured mercury levels (145
ppb). Output is tied back to the Lewak Emas FPSO, which has production
capacity of 30,000 b/d of oil and 89 mmcfd of gas. Future plans are to
tie production from the nearby Dua field to the FPSO when it comes
online in 2013. Premier operates the field and holds a 53.13 percent
interest. Other participants are Santos (31.88 percent) and
PetroVietnam (15 percent).

Blend, is a light gravity, low sulfur crude with an API of 30.6 degrees
, 0.14 wt percent sulfur and high crude pour point of 80 degrees F. It
is a blend produced from the output of the East Mibale, Tshiende,
Liawenda, Kinkasi, Makelekese, Muanda and Kifuku fields. Crude oil from
all the fields, except the Tshiende field and the shut in East Mibale
field, are sent to the Kinkasi gathering station via pipeline or truck
then transported with Thiende output to the Mibale processing station
for water and salt separation. Once processed, the crude is piped via a
4-km, 16-in pipeline to the Parenco operated offshore Mibale platform
where the crude undergoes further desalination as well as co-mingling.
COCO is stored in the Kalamu FSO which has a 1.1 million boe storage
capacity. Kinkasi and East Mibale, the first streams to come on stream,
started up in 1980. COCO's initial recoverable reserves were 107

to the market at the end of 2001 with the commissioning of a 1,580km
pipeline by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). The CPC pipeline
links major oil fields in Western Kazakhstan to a Black Sea export
terminal opened in 2001 at Yuzhnaya Ozereevka, located 40km North-West
of Novorossiysk (Russia). At the end of 2004, CPC Blend consisted of
seven crude oil streams: Tengiz, Aktobe, Kumkol, Martyshi, Arman,
Karachaganak and Siberian Light. The most significant developments in
2004 were the introduction of Karachaganak in June, and the beginning
of Russian crude injection, principally Siberian Light, in November.
Despite new streams being injected to the pipeline, Tengiz remains the
single largest component of CPC Blend. CPC blend is a very light, low
sulfur (mistaken taken as sweet), somewhat waxy crude oil.  This crude
contains a lot of mercaptans and may have H2S although H2S is stripped
from the crude as part of the stabilization process. Aluminium below

constructing more than 80 miles of pipeline, as well as upgrading
existing pumping stations and constructing new ones. The so-called full
field development stage will be complete by the end of 1997. This phase
comprises further field development and expansion of the existing
pipeline from Cusiana to Coveas. Additional tankage is being built at
Coveas to allow the segregation of Cusiana from other lower-quality

2009 averaged 120,000 b/d, down from its peak production rate of
215,000 b/d in 2004. Although new fields were introduced, production
has steadily declined because of the field s geographical complexity,
effects of early water breakthrough, and lack of reservoir pressure.

significant importance due to its capability of producing both gas and
more oil than other traditional shale plays. It contains a much higher
carbonate shale percentage, upwards to 70 percent in south Texas, and
becomes shallower and the shale content increases as it moves to the
northwest. The high percentage of carbonate makes it more brittle and
fracable . The shale play trends across Texas from the Mexican border
up into East Texas, roughly 50 miles wide and 400 miles long with an
average thickness of 250 feet. It is Cretaceous in age resting between
the Austin Chalk and the Buda Lime at a depth of approximately 4,000 to
12,000 feet. It is the source rock for the Austin Chalk and the giant

combined into a single stream at the Ekofisk hub and is then
transported by the 700,000 b/d Norpipe pipeline to Teesside, UK for
tanker loading and export. Other crudes from the UK fields in the
J-Block of the Fulmar area of the UK central North Sea are tied into
the Ekofisk-Teeside pipeline to the UK's east coast. The field, which
came online in 1971, is located 320 km off of the coast of Norway. The
initial reserve estimate was 3.5 billion boe. By year end 2009, 769
million boe remain, however 10 other Norwegian fields that contribute
to the blend contain 808 million boe. The average production rate for
2009 was 387,000 b/d, down 38,000 b/d from the previous year. The

Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil's interests in the area including the
long-term concession granted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Getty

were consumed locally until the refining facilities were destroyed in
1993 during the Gulf War and Ratawi crude had to be exported. Ratawi is
produced from the smaller, deeper Ratawi reservoir of the Wafra field
while Eocene is produced from the larger, shallow Eocene reservoir
which overlays the Ratawi accumulation. Production from the two fields
is divided equally between Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The Buzzard field, which came on stream in 2007, contributes 30 percent
making it the main contributor to the blend. Forties is a light gravity
(38.7 degrees API), low sulfur crude oil (0.8 wt percent). Output from
the contributing fields are transported onshore through the BP operated
Forties Pipeline System (FPS) to Cruden Bay in Aberdeenshire then piped
further to Hounds Point. BP is the largest interest holder of the

issued guidance on the effect that introduct ion of oil from the
Nexen-operated Buzzard Field into the FPS would be expected to have on
Forties Blend crude oil when Buzzard begins production.  Oil from the

late in 2006 and build up to peak production of approximately 210,000

indic ate that the oil is a medium gravity, sour crude with an API of
32.6 degrees and whole crude sulphur level of 1.44% wt. Current Forties
Blend crude (sampled in march 2005) has an API of 44.6 degrees and

19.8 degrees and 0.7 wt percent sulfur. The crude also has high arsenic
levels (56 ppb) and is expected to produce a vacuum residuum that is
high in nitrogen (10,300 ppm). Frade's initial recoverable reserves are
estimated at 245 million boe, with 196 million boe remaining (2011).
The field came onstream in June 2009 with an initial production rate of
5,000 b/d. Peak production of 70,000 b/d was reached in 2011. Frade
output is tied back to the Frade FPSO, which has a crude processing
capacity of 100,000 b/d and a storage capacity of 1.5 million boe.

about 1,400 bo/d, but additional exploration and development
opportunities exist, particularly on the eastern side of the block.
Petrotrin estimates remaining potential reserves of 200 to 500 MMbo.

Block 17, Angola went from being a solid but average oil producing
country to become a hotspot in the global search for major oil
reserves.
When Girassol came on stream in late 2001, the line on
Angola's oil production graph moved upwards exponentially. It is a
trend that is set to continue as more offshore fields are brought into
production.
Thus far, deep water discoveries off Angola's Atlantic
coast have reached success rates of about 80%. On Block 17, commercial
discoveries were found in all drilled wells - Rose, Dahlia, Orchid,
Jasmine, Tulip and Sunflower (Girassol in Portuguese).
The total
oil production for Angola in 2001 was below one million barrels per
day (bpd). By the end of 2005 production of crude in Angola surpassed
1.4 million bpd and that it will reach two million bpd in the first
trimester of 2008.With the fast-paced advance of drilling technology
and the success of Blocks 15 and 17, there are great expectations for
results of ultra-deep water (i.e. drilling at depths greater than
2.000 meters) exploration off Angola's coast.
Angolan ultra deep
water Blocks are numbered 31 to 34. With reserves of blocks 31 and 32
estimated to be at about 800 million barrels within the next 15 years
Angola may become one of the major oil producers in the southern
hemisphere.

The field was discovered by Hydro in 1991, and came on stream on 23
September 2003.  Grane is the first field on the Norwegian continental
shelf to produce heavy crude oil. This oil differs from other types in
that it is found in younger geological formations than what is usual on
the continental shelf, namely in sandstone from the Tertiary period,
deposited around 60 million years ago. The oil is transported by
pipeline to the Sture terminal, where it is stored in large rock
caverns in the mountainside prior to shipment to the world market. The
field receives natural gas from the Heimdal Gas Centre through a 50
kilometre long pipeline. The gas is injected as pressure support into
the reservoir, to ensure high production and extraction rates.

Sleipner West fields. It is a light gravity (48.7 degrees API), low
sulfur (0.09 wt percent) crude oil. Output from the field is tied back
to the Sleipner A platform then sent to the Karsto terminal for export.
Gudrun started production in April 2014 and produces 46,800 b/d (2016).
Recoverable reserves are estimated at 75 million barrels of oil and 16
million barrels of LPG, of which 49 million barrels of condensate and
12 million barrels of LPG remains. Gudrun is operated by Statoil (36
percent). Partners include Engie EandP (25 percent), Repsol Oil and Gas
Canada (15 percent) and OMV (24 percent).

Orinoco Oil Tar Belt upgrader project which takes place at the Jose
refinery complex located on the northern coast of Venezuela. Extra
heavy crude from the Petropiar field is piped via a 55-km, 30-inch
pipeline to PDVSA's Patio de Tanques de Oficina then piped through a
175-km, 42-inch line to the Jose refinery complex. The crude then goes
through a process that upgrades extra heavy (6-8 degrees API), sour
crudes from the Orinoco Tar Belt to a lighter, synthetic crude of 25-26
degrees API and Sulfur content of 2 wt percent through a series of
processes that involve dilution with naphtha to facilitate transport to
the upgrading facility, diluent removal and re-cycling, hydrocracking,
high-temperature gasification processes, desulphurization, coking, and
blending. The Hamaca upgrader has the capacity to process 200,000 b/d
of extra heavy crude into 190,000 b/d synthetic crude (95 percent
conversion), 4,000 tons/day of coke, and 600 tons/day of Sulphur. The
Hamaca concession, which includes the Boyaca (Machete), Junin (Zuata),
Ayacucho (Hamaca), and Carabobo (Cerro Negro) fields, covers 160,000
acres, has a oil in place estimate of 235 billion boe, and holds 1.419
billion barrels of bitumen. Remaining reserves are 760 million barrels
of bitumen. Production began in 2002, but the upgrader project did not
begin until 2004. Average production of syncrude is 71,300 b/d and
heavy oil is 55,000 b/s (2016). Hamaca Blend is a viscous (1270 cSt at
20 degrees C), heavy gravity (17.1 degrees ), mid-level sulfur (2.27 wt
percent) crude with a high As concentration (64.6 ppb). It is expected
to produce a vacuum residuum with high Nitrogen (11,700 ppm), Ni
(1060 ppm), and MCRT (31.5 wt percent) concentrations. Petroleos
Venezuela, the operator, holds a 70 percent interest and Chevron holds
the remaining 30 percent.

kilometres (196 mi) east-southeast of St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.
Hibernia crude is produced in the Jean D'Arc Basin and loaded at the
IMTT-operated NTL Terminal in Newfoundland. The production rate of the
field is approximately 150 thousand b/d. Chevron has a 30% interest.
As the Hibernia field was located in an extremely inhospitable
environment consisting of rogue waves, fog, icebergs and sea ice,
hurricanes, and nor'easter winter storms, engineering analyses
determined that the most appropriate drilling platform would be in the
form of a gravity base structure.  Production commenced on November 17,
1997 and Hibernia has proven to be the most prolific oil well in
Canada, with initial production rates in excess of 50,000 barrels of
oil equivalent per day from a single well. A dedicated fleet of shuttle
tankers continuously operates between the platform and an onshore
transshipment facility at Whiffen Head.

in 2002, holds a total of 4 billion boe, of which 617 million boe in
the post salt reservoir and 157 million in the pre-salt reservoir is
recoverable. By year end 2011, about 502 million and 146 million boe,
respectively remain. Total production in 2010 averaged 55,000 b/d.
Output from the field is tied back to the P-57 FPSO which has a

began production under Karachaganckgazprom, a subsidiary of the Russian
Gas Company Gazprom. Kazakhgas took over operatorship after the
independence of Kazakhstan in 1992. in 1992 AGIP (now Eni) and the then
British Gas (now BG Group) were awarded the sole negotiating rights,
forming a partnership company. In 1997 Texaco (now Chevron Corporation)
and Lukoil signed a production sharing agreement with the original two
companies and the Kazakhstan Government. This is a 40-year agreement to
develop the field to allow the production to reach world markets. This
is done under a partnership company known as Karachaganak Petroleum
Operating (KPO) where BG Group and ENI are joint operators with a 32.5%
stake each in the company, with Chevron and Lukoil owning 20% and 15%
respectively. with a hydrogen sulphide content of 3.5-5% and carbon
dioxide content of 5%. Karachaganckgazprom maintained a policy of full
gas voidage replacement to maintain pressure of the reservoir above the
dew point. The Karachaganak Field is one of the world's largest gas
condensate fields. It is located in the Pre-Caspian (or North Caspian)
Basin, which extends from the southeastern margin of the Russian
Platform down to the northern coast of the Caspian Sea, and includes
the offshore Caspian Sea north of about 44 N The field consists of a
heterogeneous carbonate massif with strata from three geologic periods
and numerous stages of deposition during these periods. The following

of northeastern Alberta, Canada about 70 km north of Fort McMurray. The
Kearl Oil Sands Project will be the world's largest open-pit mining
operations for producing bitumen. It is a mid-gravity (20.3 degrees
API), high sulfur (3.83 wt percent) and acidic (1.84 mg KOG/g) dilbit.
Production started in April of 2013 with an initial bitumen production
rate of 110,000 b/d and diluted bitumen production of 160,000 b/d. The
Kearl oil sands area has initial recoverable reserves of 3.239 billion
barrels of bitumen of which, about 3.231 million barrels of bitumen
remains. The project duration is expected to reach 30 years. Imperial
Oil Resources operates the project.

It is the opinion of this ERTC that the resid cracked and the

asphaltenes, metals, and mcr levels in the hvgo. Cuts are very
narrow and given the discontinuity of the first distillation and
the high temp(700f) of the first distillation, the second distillation
appeared pre-disposed to crack. The cuts are very narrow and the
reported temperatures are not necessarily the achieved cutpts reported.
Without simdis on the fractions, this is difficult to document but the
separation is a remarkable echo of the simdis data. ERTC/this author has
adjusted the data to be consistent with TBP (not simdis) data. ITS also
non-monotonic gravities for an aromatic crude-- probably a function of
cracking.  Also some strangeness in the aniline data.

field located offshore Abu Dhabi midway between Das Island and Abu
Dhabi. The field was discovered in 1963 and came onstream in 1967. Oil
in place at Zakum Lower is estimated at 16 billion boe, of which 4.211
billion boe are recoverable and about 737 million boe (2012) remains.
In 2011, production averaged 300,000 b/d. The field is split into two
zones, Zakum West and Zakum Central, each of which have supercomplexes
where the crudes are processed. Zakum West and Zakum Central are linked
by a 175,000 b/d capacity, 10 km, 24-inch pipeline. The crude is then
transported via a 310,000 b/d capacity pipeline to ADMA's processing
and export terminal on Das Island. Lower Zakum is a light gravity ( 40
degrees API), low sulfur crude oil ( 1 wt percent). It is owned and
operated by the Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company partners which
include Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (60 percent), BP (14.67
percent), Jodco (12 percent) and Total SA (13.33 percent).

Production, which started up in 1974, average 10,000 b/d in 2011. Block
8 had initial recoverable reserves of 323 million boe, of which 22
million boe remain. Most of the crude from Block 8 is transported
through the Petroperu owned pipeline system, Oleoducto Nor-Peruano
(North Peru Pipeline), to the export terminal of Bayovar on the Pacific
coast where it is marketed as Mayna blend. The remaining crude is
barged to the Iquitos refinery. Mayna is medium gravity, low sulfur
crude oil with an API of 21.1 degrees and sulfur content of 0.7 wt
percent. The crude is also expected to produce a high atmospheric
residuum yield (74 vol percent). Mayna is operated by Pluspetrol Norte,
a joint venture where Pluspetrol holds 55 percent and China National
Petroleum Corporation holds 45 percent interest. Owners of the field

Myton is a category of Black wax which was
recently inspected. It used to be equity before it was sold to
Newfield. Myton is a sibling to Altamont crude which is aka Yellow Wax
Crude. However, there is no field of this name. Myton is an oil city in
Utah. It is not a field itself. The name is derived from the location
of the terminal. The PL itself is operated by Chevron. Much of the
black wax is on Ute Indian reservation and refineries are opting for
the cheaper Canadian crude now available. The Uintah Basin accounts for
the largest percentage of oil production in Utah, with its heavy
paraffinic Black Wax Crude. Much of it is trucked. The oil from this
area of Utah is known as ""Uinta Basin Black Wax Crude"" and has to be
refined differently than most types of oil. Myton gets its name from
the Myton Petroleum Pipeline Pumping Station. Chevron Pipeline Company
operates the Myton petroleum pumping station. It receives crude oil
from the company owned fleet of transport trucks for delivery into the
heated and insulated pipeline that makes its way to Salt Lake City. The
Myton station serves as an entry point to pipeline operations. Giving
that the crude is trucked, variation can result from the differing
volumes from the local producers. Typically this stuff is 31-32API

Nemba is a light gravity (37.5 degrees API), low sulfur (0.3 wt
percent) crude oil that is produced from several fields offshore
Cabinda Area B in the lower Congo Basin located adjacent to the Cabinda
coastline offshore Angola. In 2006, Benguela-Belize-Lobito-Tomboco
(BBLT) in Block 14 came on stream and started contributing to the grade
and in 2013, the heavier Benguela field, which was sent to the Kuito
stream, was rerouted to Nemba making it a heavier grade. BBLT volumes
will vary and can contribute 10-14 percent to the Nemba stream. Nemba
came on stream in 1996 and has initial recoverable reserves of 757
billion boe. Remaining reserves (2014) is about 189 million boe. BBLT
initial reserves were 474 million boe, of which 198 million barrels
remain (2014). In 2013, Cabinda Area B production averaged 41,000 b/d
and BBLT production averaged 71,000 b/d. Chevron operates both the
Nemba and BBLT areas and holds 39.2 percent and 31 percent interest,
respectively. Other Nemba partners are Sonangol (41 percent), Total (10
percent) and Eni (9.8 percent) and BBLT partners are Angola Block 14
B.V. (20 percent), Eni (20 percent), Sonangol PandP (20 percent), Galp

Svale and Staer satellite fields. In March 2013, the Skuld field went
onstream and was tied back to the Norne FPSO which can process 220,000

6608/10 and 6608/11, approximately 124 miles from the Norwegian coast
in water depth of 380 meters. Norne came onstream in 1997, Urd started
up in 2005 and Alve, a gas and condensate field, started up in 2009.
Initial recoverable reserve for Norne and Skuld was 665 million boe, of
which 108 million boe remain (2013). Total production in 2013 is
expected to average 51,100 b/d (14,000 b/d from Norne and 37,500 b/d

60,000 b/d capacity Oben flowstation then transported to the Forcados
terminal via the Amukpe-Rapele pipeline where it is blended into the
Forcados grade. The Oben field had initial recoverable reserves of 226
million bbl of oil and 953 bcf of gas. Remaining reserves as of January
1, 2011 are 24 million bbl of oil and 642 bcf gas. The field is
operated by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Corporation (NPDC) which
holds 24.75 percent interest. Septa Energy holds 30.25 percent and
SEPLAT Petroleum Development, a consortium with two Nigerian companies,
Platform Petroleum and Shebah Petroleum and Maurel and Prom, holds 45
percent interest.

Royal Dutch Shell (34 percent), Total (4 percent), and Partex (2
percent). The blend comes from 21 mature oil fields located in the
north and central regions of the country, including the large Yibal,
Fahud and Mukhaizna fields. In 2013, production averaged 885,000 b/d.
Oman Export Blend is transported to the Mina al-Fahal port via the Main
Oil Line (MOL) and the South Main Oil Line (SMOL). The crude's quality
is expected to decrease over time as contributions from the heavy
Marmul field increases and production from the older, lighter fields
declines. Oman Export Blend is a light (30.5 degrees API) crude with a
sulfur concentration of 1.39 wt percent.

reserves. Combined proven and probable reserves are roughly 3.6
billion barrels. Most of the country's reserves contain heavy, sour
crude oil with gravities in the 25o API to 30 API range. The bulk of
current exploration and production activity is focused in the Oriente,
or Ecuador's Amazon basin region. Ecuador's oil has become
increasingly heavy in recent years as new reserves have had higher
gravities than reserves in older, declining fields. Under Ecuador's
constitution, all subsurface resources are property of the state, but
foreign oil companies are allowed to assist in production activities.
Ishpingo, Tiputini, and Panacocha heavy oil (10-15 API) fields in
the northeastern part of the country, constitute Ecuador's largest
known reserves of heavy oil, with more than 710 million barrels of
recoverable reserves, according to Petroecuador.
The 312-mile long
SOTE pipeline connects the oil-rich Oriente region to the Balao export
terminal located near Esmeraldas.
Oriente crudes are becoming
heavier and more viscous as new fields in the area are brought online.
 So a parallel line was built to carry the heavier crude which need
more pumps to handle the viscosity.
this sample is of the heavier grade of crude from the region.

resources. Production started in 2016 at an initial rate of 2,000 b/d.
PR Springs Bitumen is heavy gravity (12.8 degrees API), low sulfur
(0.37 wt percent), acidic (1.56 mg KOH/g), viscous (177,000 cSt at 20
degrees C) and has a high pour point (91.2 degrees F). It also has high
lead (600 ppb) and calcium (4150 ppm) concentrations. The atmospheric
and vacuum residuum yields are expected to be high (84.2 vol percent
and 48.5 vol percent, respectively).

Puffin Area Additions (5.2 MMstb high estimate) and the Fairfield

from Puffin-2 is approximately 48 0 API and the oil from Puffin-5 is of

Ross was discovered in North Sea in 1981 and
started production from 1999 by operator Encana. Located in the Outer
Moray Firth area of the UK North Sea, the Greater Ross area consists of
three fields: Ross, Blake and Blake Flank. Owned and operated by
different companies, these three fields are developed by the same FPSO.
The Bleo Holm FPSO, located on the Ross field, receives and transports
oil from Ross, Blake and Blake Flank fields. The Ross oil field is
situated in the outer Moray Firth on Blocks 13/28a and 13/29a, 60 km
north of the Scottish coast and 30 km to the south-east of the Captain
field. Originally, Ross was designed to be a small and short
development, but its life expectancy was increased when an adjacent
field, Blake, extended Ross's reserves. Once Blake came online, another
field was explored in the area named Blake Flank, which added to the
area's production life. The Ross field spans across three blocks: UKCS
13/28a, 13/28c and 13/29a. The field is roughly 48 miles (77
kilometers) northeast of St. Fergus, UK, and 72 miles (116 kilometers)
northeast of Aberdeen in a water depth of 360 feet (110 meters). This

History The Rubiales field was discovered in 1982, but was abandoned
because the economics of producing heavy oil at that time could not
justify the cost of extraction. In July 2002, Meta Petroleum became the
field operator of the Rubiales and Piriri concessions and in that same
year, drilled six wells, achieving production of 940 bbl/d. In 2003

Offshore Unit. It was replaced with a nw tanker called Concorde with a
storage capacity of 230,000 bbls. The field recommenced production at a
rate of 3,500 bpd from the SED-1A well. The SED-1A well was drilled in
2006 employing under-balanced drilling (UBD) technology to maximize the
productive potential of the Ngimbang carbonate reservoir. Crude from
this well is 32.2 API gravity with a pour point of 115 *F. BP Migas
approved the plan of development for the field in November 2005

Sahara (desert), north-central Libya; it is the site of one of the
world's largest oil fields. The region fronts the Mediterranean Sea for
about 300 miles (480 km) along the southern part of the Gulf of Sidra
and extends generally southeastward through the Sirte (Surt) Basin. It
is bordered on the west by the northwest-southeast-running volcanic
massif of Al-Haruj al-Aswad (rising to 3,937 feet [1,200 m]). Sirtica
was isolated from the ancient Greek (eastern) and Punic (western)
cultural trends, and as a result it was a refuge for outcasts. About
500 BC an altar was erected in the region to mark the boundary between
the Greek and Punic realms. Sirtica also formed the dividing line
between the Muslim west (the Maghrib) and the Muslim east (the Mashriq)
from the 7th century AD. The bulk of Libya's oil deposits are scattered
throughout the Sirtica region and in the Sirte Basin in particular; the
Sarir oil field is located southeast of the region. The petroleum
reservoirs in the Sirtica are estimated to lie at depths of between 500
and 13,000 feet (150 and 4,000 m) below the surface. Commercial
exploitation began in 1959 at Dahra field. Zaltan, the largest field in
Libya, was discovered the same year and lies about 105 miles (169 km)
south of the Mediterranean port of Mars Al-Burayqah. The crude
extracted in the Sirtica region is light and has a low sulfur content.
The oil is transported northwestward by pipeline to terminals at
As-Sidrah, Ra`s al-Unuf, Mars al-Burayqah, and Az-Zuwaytinah on the
Gulf of Sidra. Besides petroleum extraction, salt is also produced in
large quantities.

Norwegian section of the Barents Sea north of the Artic Circle that
holds both condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. The field
came on stream in September 2007. Initial recoverable reserves are

gas is produced from 10 wells, which includes six located on the main
Snohvit reservoir, one CO2 injection well, and three on the Albatross
accumulation south of Snohvitthe field. The output is transported
through a 143 km pipeline to the onshore Melkoya LNG plant where the
condensate is separated and the gas is liquefied into LNG. Carbon
dioxide, which is also produced, is separated and sent back to the
field for injection and storage in the Tubasen shale-capped sandstone
formation below the producing zones. Two more wells are planned for
2011 and in 2014-2015, Askeladd will be developed. Snohvit average

(1.8 wt percent) crude oil that has a high measured Ca content (299
ppm). The offshore, deepwater oil field is located in the WR 678 block
in the US Gulf of Mexico, in 6,900 ft water depths. Recoverable
reserves are estimated at 383 million barrels of oil and 96 bcf gas.
St. Malo and the nearby Jack field, which holds an additional 230
million boe and 60 bcf gas, will be jointly developed and are expected
to start production in 2014. Output from both fields, as well as
production from nearby fields, will be tied back to a floating
production unit with a production capacity of 177,000 barrels of
oil-equivalent per day. From there, the produced oil will be
transported through the Chevron Pipeline Company operated Jack and St.
Malo (JSM) Oil Export Pipeline (OEP) to the Shell operated Boxer
Platfrom located in Green Canyon block 19 (GC-19). The crude will then
be tied into the Amberjack pipeline system which terminates at
Fourchon, Louisiana. Chevron operates the field and holds 51 percent
interest. Other partners are Petrobras (25 percent), Statoil (21.5
percent) ExxonMobil (1.25 percent) and ENI (1.25 percent).

component, came on line in 2003 and production for Sutu Den Northeast
began in May 2010. Sutu Vang initiated in 2008 and Sutu Trang is
targeted to begin in 2012. Sutu Den is a waxy, light, low sulfur crude
(36 deg API and 0.07 weight percent Sulfur). Production of the Sutu Den
field is in decline because of water pressure issues associated with
fractured basement reservoirs in the Cuu Long Basin, however this is
offset by an increase production of the lighter Sutu Vang (37 deg API)
which is causing an increase in the blend s API. Production rates in
2009 averaged 93,000 b/d and are expected to increase in 2010 and
beyond as Sutu Den Northeast production ramps up and Sutu Trang comes
on line. The fields are operated by the Cuu Long Joint Operating Co., a
joint venture between Petrovietnam (50 percent), ConocoPhillips (23.3
percent), Korea National Oil Corp. (14.2 percent), SK Innovation (9

output. Operators Petronas and Exxon have signed a 25 year production
sharing contract that calls for enhanced oil recovery techniques that
is expected to increase output by 2013. Exxon operates 10 fields and
owns 30 percent equity. Petronas operates the other six fields and is

Nearly all of Malaysia's oil comes from offshore fields. The

Canada's East Coast. Terra Nova is the first harsh environment
development in North America to use a Floating Production Storage and
Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the Terra Nova FPSO. Production from the
field began in January 2002. The oil is produced from the Late

(42.4%) in partnership with Kairiki Energy (30.1%), Trafigura Ventures
(15%) and TG World (BVI) Corp (12.5%). Crude is 25.7-26.4*API with
about 2.4% sulfur and form of the sulfur is in the mercaptan form.
Crude is wet and water production is an issue.  Asphaltenes and MCR are

about 18 m. It was discovered in 1958 and began producing in January
1962. Umm Shaif's initial reserves were estimated at 4.033 billion boe
of which about 756 million boe remain (2011). Although production
capacity is at 250,000 b/d, the production rate was held to 213,000 b/d
in 2010 because of OPEC cuts. Production capacity is expected to
increase to 300,000 b/d once the Umm Shaif gas injection project is
completed sometime in 2012. Umm Shaif is a light crude (36.9 degrees
API) with a sulfur content of 1.44 wt percent. Output is processed in
the Umm Shaif super complex then transported to the Das Island terminal
via two main oil lines that have a combined capacity of over 40,000
b/d. Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Co. (Adma-Opco), a joint operating
company comprised of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (Adnoc, 60 percent), BP
(14.67 percent), Total (13.33 percent) and Japan Oil Development Co.
(12 percent) owns and operates the field. In 2018, the concession is
set to expire and it is unclear if Adnoc will continue with the
existing partnership or open the contract area to new players through a
competitive bidding process.

Mississippian age, is one of the largest continuous oil formations that
spans about 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2) of the subsurface of the
Williston Basin, covering northwestern South Dakota, and southern
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. Bakken contains 3 to 4.3 billion
barrels of technically recoverable oil. Production began in 1953 and
cumulative production through 2008 was 135 million boe. The development
and application of horizontal drilling and horizontal fracturing have
increased activity in the area. Production in 2011 reached 600,000 b/d.
Oil is transported through the North Dakota Pipeline System, a 161,000
bpd pipeline operated by Enbridge Energy Partners, LP. The 330-mile
crude oil gathering and 620-mile interstate transportation system
gathers crude oil from points near producing wells to Clearbrook, Minn.
From there, it is either connected to the Lakehead System, a 1,900 mile
pipeline system that transports crude oil from Western Canada to the
Gulf Coast, or to a third-party pipeline that transports crude oil to
refineries in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. Other modes of
transportation include rail and truck. Several companies are operating
in the Bakken formation; most notable are Continental Resources, EOG,
Whiting, ConocoPhillips, Statoil, and Hess. Bakken, a light crude that
ranges from 39-46 degrees API, accounts for 10 percent of the US daily
production.

Zafiro is a light gravity, low sulfur crude oil (30.6 degrees API and
0.27 wt percent sulfur) that is expected to produce a vacuum residuum
with a high Nitrogen content (12,900 ppm). In 2005, the Serpentina FPSO
